        In addition to cookies, we may use web beacons, pixel tags, and other
        tracking technologies on the Site to help customize the Site and improve
        your experience. A “web beacon” or “pixel tag” is tiny object or image
        embedded in a web page or email. They are used to track the number of
        users who have visited particular pages and viewed emails and acquire
        other statistical data. They collect only a limited set of data, such as
        a cookie number, time and date of page or email view, and a description
        of the page or email on which they reside. Web beacons and pixel tags
        cannot be declined. However, you can limit their use by controlling the
        cookies that interact with them.
